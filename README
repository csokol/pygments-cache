INSTALLING:
 * Run "sudo python setup.py install". You need setuptools and pygments packages installed.
 * You can also install directly from github: "sudo easy_install https://github.com/csokol/pygments-cache/tarball/master"
 * Create the dir to hold your cache at ~/.pygments/cache (something like "mkdir -p ~/.pygmentize/cache" should work) 
 * Optionally, replace your pygmentize script for pygmentize-cached. You can find the path to your pygmentize executable by running "which pygmentize".

USING:
 * To use the cached version, simply run pygmentize-cached. All arguments valid for pygmentize script is also valid for pygmentize-cached.
