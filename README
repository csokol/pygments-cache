INSTALLING:
 * move your original pygmentize to pygmentize-orig (something like "mv /usr/bin/pygmentize /usr/bin/pygmentize-orig" should work) you can find the path to your pygmentize executable by running "which pygmentize")
 * create the dir to hold your cache at ~/.pygments/cache (something like "mkdir -p ~/.pygmentize/cache" should work) 
 * replace your pygmentize script for this one and be happy!
